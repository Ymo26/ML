# Machine Learning/ Feature Engineering
# 📊 ML Research Repository  

Welcome to my **ML Research** repository!  
This project brings together my work at the intersection of **machine learning, econometrics, and geospatial environmental analysis**. It combines rigorous academic framing (literature review, citations, research goals) with practical tools (code, datasets, reproducible pipelines).

## 🎓 Academic Research Context  

Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative force in **economics, finance, and environmental studies**, offering enhanced predictive accuracy, interpretability, and decision-making insights.  

- **Economics & Finance**:  
  - Stock return predictability using ML vs. traditional models (Avramov et al., 2023).  
  - Integration of ML with factor-based asset pricing (Giglio et al., 2022).  
  - Reinforcement Learning (Charpentier et al., 2021) for portfolio optimization.  
  - ML for inflation (Medeiros et al., 2021) and GDP growth forecasting (Yoon, 2021).  

- **Sustainability & Policy**:  
  - ML analysis of renewable energy, CO₂ emissions, and GDP growth (Magazzino et al., 2021).  
  - Pollution, economic growth, and COVID-19 mortality (Mele & Magazzino, 2021).  

- **Applied ML Models in My Research**:  
  - **KNN** → consumer behavior & financial product recommendations.  
  - **RL** → portfolio management & dynamic pricing strategies.  
  - **K-Means** → economic segmentation & pattern discovery.  
  - **PCA** → dimensionality reduction in macroeconomic forecasting.  
  - **CNN+LSTM** → time-series forecasting (hotel ADR, stock prices).  
  - **XGBoost/GBM** → robust forecasting and classification tasks.
